# kmeans-by-myself-python
This repository include implements of k-means and k-means++ by myself using python 

## Contents of repocitory
kmeans.ipynb .. This file include implement of kmeans.  
                when I use kmeans the algorithm, I got some failure case.  
                Failure cases are causeed by problem of centroid initialization.  
                
kmeans++.ipynb .. This file include implement of kmeans++.  
                  The algorithm solve problems of kmeans.  
                  Centoroids initialization of the algorithm is based on weights of euclid disntances between centoroid and dataset.
                  Centoirds are assigned from datasets.
